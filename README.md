PyUserJourneySankey is a sample of how you can draw a beautiful Sankey diagram to amnalyze sequential events.

**Here is the story of this example:**

In out platform there are 5 events that are very important to us:
* Main Event
* Event M
* Event X
* Event Y
* Event Z


We want to track general user journey between these events. We want to know which event comes first and generally after that our users would move to which one the events. 
Sankey diagram helps us to visualize this user journey beautifully and based on the data we can analyze user behavior in a deeper level. 


The code is generally based on this article:
